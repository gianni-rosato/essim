# essim

![build](https://github.com/facebookresearch/essim/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

eSSIM[1] is an evolution of SSIM which improves correlation with subjective
scores by employing Minkowski pooling and reduces complexity by employing box
filters and striding.

This is similar to the original algorithm implemented at
https://github.com/utlive/enhanced_ssim but this project is designed for use at
scale and uses optimized floating point and integer SIMD instructions.

In addition this project replaced the CoV pooling defined in [1] with Minkowski
pooling due to edge cases with uncorrelated inputs causing abnormal scores. In
testing using Minkowski 3 (or 4) pooling preserves the subjective correlations
of CoV pooling with more stable behavior across a wide range of inputs.

In addition to the Minkowski pooled eSSIM score this library can also calculate
the arithmetic mean pooled SSIM score for reference.

## Building

This project uses CMake to build and depends on `clang-tidy` and `clang-format`
for linting and auto formatting of source files. You can install both by
installing llvm. On OS X you can use homebrew, but it won't link `llvm` so you
need to manualy symlink the related binaries.

```sh
brew install llvm
sudo ln -s "$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang-tidy" "/usr/local/bin/clang-tidy"
sudo ln -s "$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang-tidy" "/usr/local/bin/clang-format"
sudo ln -s "$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang-apply-replacements" "/usr/local/bin/clang-apply-replacements"\n
```

To build the project, use the following. Using Ninja is recommended (but
optional, omit `-G Ninja` to use Make instead)

```sh
mkdir build
cmake build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --parallel
```

CMake will download and install GoogleTest. To skip building tests you can uses

```sh
cmake build -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
```

Assuming you didn't skip building tests you can run tests using `ctest`

```sh
ctest --output-on-failure
```

To install, run:

```sh
cmake --install build
sudo cp inc/*.h /usr/local/include/essim  # you may need this
```

## Build x86 on ARM based MacOS

To build x86 code instead of ARM on MacOS machines with M1 or later ARM CPUs you
can use the `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` flag

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64
```

## FFmpeg Integration

To build ffmpeg with eSSIM support, apply the patch to an ffmpeg 6.0 checkout
and run `./configure` with `--enable-libessim`.
